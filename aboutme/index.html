    <h2>Andy Jimenez</h2>
    <p>Hi everyone!, I am from Guatemala City, Guatemala and I am 22 years old. I am really excited to be on this class, 
    I really want to learn all about web page design. Some things that I love to do are: 1) I really love to play the piano, 
    I am not good at all but I am practicing a lot and I am currently learning to play the song I Giorni by Ludovico Einaudi. 
    2) I like to play soccer and to do workout.</p>
    <p>I am taking this course because since I was a kid I saw my mother and one of my uncles working with the computer so then 
    I was interested in that and now I am here willing to learn in this class and after that putting it in practice for my future job.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Chirst of Latter Day Saints since I was born and 
    I served a mission in Oaxaca, Mexico for almost 2 years now.</p>
