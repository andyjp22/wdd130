       <h1>Passport and VISA provisions</h1> 
       <p>All passports should be valid for a minimum of 6 months from the date of entry in Guatemala. Most countries do not require a visa for stays of 90 days or less. Please make sure to contact your Embassy for relevant information in your native language.
            Guatemala is part of the Central America-4 Border Control Agreement - a treaty of frontiers with El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua.  The agreement allows locals and visitors to travel freely among these four countries without any extra checks or restrictions.
            Check this link for information in Spanish about Guatemala's visa requirements from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
        <h1>Getting around by land</h1>
        <p>We strongly recommend private transportation above public buses and shuttles. However, if you feel adventurous and speak some Spanish, traveling the local way is a unique experience. You can either rent a car or travel on the famous chicken buses. We must warn you that our streets and highways are not in the best shape (specially during rainy season).</p>
        <h1>Power adapters</h1>
        <p>The standard voltage in Guatemala is 120 V and the same plugs as in the US. Depending on your country of residence you will need to bring a plug adapter (usually Type A / B). Ideally you bring a universal power strip to charge several devices at once.</p>
